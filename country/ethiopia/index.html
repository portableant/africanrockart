The eastern part mostly consists of a range of plateaus and high mountains, which in some cases reach more than 4000m above sea level. To the north of these mountains is Lake Tana, the biggest lake in Ethiopia and the source of the Blue Nile, one of the two tributaries of the Nile. The mountains are divided in two by the Great Rift Valley, which runs north-east to south-west, - and is one of the most important areas for the study of human evolution. The highlands are surrounded by tropical savannah and grassland regions to the west and south-west, while to the east lays the Danakil desert, one of the most inhospitable regions on earth. The south-eastern corner of Ethiopia, which borders Somalia, is a semi-desert plateau ranging from 300-1500 m above sea level.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="ETHNAS0005" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/300x180/ETHNAS0005.jpg 300w,  https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/ETHNAS0005.jpg 540w" data-src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/ETHNAS0005.jpg" src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/low/ETHNAS0005.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://bit.ly/2jqquJj"> View of landscape in southern Ethiopia. 2013,2034.16171 © David Coulson/TARA </a> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-content"> <p><p>Ethiopian rock art is located around two main areas: around the city of Harar to the east and the Sidamo region to the south-west. The first group comprises mainly painted depictions, while the second one is characterized by a bas-relief technique specific only to this area. However, rock art has also been discovered in other areas, such as the border with Eritrea, the area near Kenya and the Benishangul-Gumuz region, a lowland area along the border with Sudan. As research increases, it is likely that more rock art sites will be discovered throughout the country. In addition to these engravings and paintings, Ethiopia is also known for its decorated stelae, tall stone obelisks that are usually engraved with culturally and religiously important symbols. One of these places is Tiya, a burial place declared a World Heritage Site which has 32 richly decorated stelae. Although not strictly rock art in the traditional sense, they nevertheless represent one of the most interesting group of archaeological remains in the south of Ethiopia and demonstrate similar techniques to some of the engraved depictions.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="2013,2034.16248" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/300x180/2013_2034.16248.jpg 300w,  https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/2013_2034.16248.jpg 540w" data-src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/2013_2034.16248.jpg" src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/low/2013_2034.16248.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://bit.ly/2i9tddD"> View of engraved cow with curved horns and marked udders.

Research started as early as the mid-1930s when the Abbé Henri Breuil proposed a classification of Ethiopian rock art through the study of the Porc-Epic and Genda-Biftou sites. This proposal stated a progressive evolution in eight steps from naturalism to schematism, and set the interpretative framework for succeeding decades. Breuil’s ideas were generally followed by John Desmond Clark in his synthesis of the rock art in the Horn of Africa in 1954, and they also appear in the work of Paolo Graziosi (1964). During the 1960s, research was carried out by Francis Anfray in the Sidamo area and by Gerard Bailloud near Harar, where a report made for the Ethiopian government informed about the existence of around ten rock art sites in the same area.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="ETHLAG0010030" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/300x180/ETHLAG0010030.jpg 300w,  https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/ETHLAG0010030.jpg 540w" data-src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/ETHLAG0010030.jpg" src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/low/ETHLAG0010030.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://bit.ly/2j3OmG6"> View of painted cattle and human figures.

The existence of this style is currently the paradigm used in most rock art interpretations of the region, although some concerns have been raised due to its too generic characteristics, which can be found in many other parts of Africa. The 1990s and 2000s have seen a remarkable increase of rock art research in the country, with the renewal of studies in the main areas and the beginning of research in the regions of Tigray and Benishangul-Gumuz.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="ETHDAG0010003" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/300x180/ETHDAG0010003.jpg 300w,  https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/ETHDAG0010003.jpg 540w" data-src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/ETHDAG0010003.jpg" src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/low/ETHDAG0010003.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://bit.ly/2iAVSEX"> View of rock shelter full of humped cattle, human figures and unidentified shapes.

The oldest depictions (based on Červiček’s works) are of humpless cows, while in the late stages of rock art humped cows and camels appear. Goats, sheep and dogs are very occasionally depicted, and unlike the Saharan rock art, wild animals such as giraffes and antelopes are scarce. Figures of cattle appear alone or in herds, and the depictions of cows with calves are a fairly common motif not only in Ethiopia but in the whole Horn of Africa.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="ETHKIM0010014" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/300x180/ETHKIM0010014.jpg 300w,  https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/ETHKIM0010014.jpg 540w" data-src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/ETHKIM0010014.jpg" src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/low/ETHKIM0010014.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://bit.ly/2iB07QT"> Group of humped cattle painted in white, with round heads.

In some cases, the tendency to schematism is so pronounced that human figures are reduced to an H-like shape. Sometimes, human figures are represented as warriors, carrying weapons and on occasion fighting against other humans or big felines. Along with these figurative themes, geometric signs are very common in Ethiopian rock art, including groups of dots and other motifs that have been interpreted as symbols associated with groups that historically lived in the region.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="ETHKIM0010016" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/300x180/ETHKIM0010016.jpg 300w,  https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/ETHKIM0010016.jpg 540w" data-src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/ETHKIM0010016.jpg" src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/low/ETHKIM0010016.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://bit.ly/2jqRjNt"> View of schematic, red human figure.

In Sidamo, almost all figures depict humpless cows, while subjects in the Harar region show a far bigger variability. Again, differences in techniques are also evident: while depictions in the Harar region are mainly paintings, in Sidamo many figures are engraved in a very singular way, lowering the area around the figures to achieve a bas-relief effect. The clear differences between the Sidamo engravings (known as the Chabbé-Galma group) and those of the Harar (the Laga Oda-Sourré group) have led to criticisms about the perceived uniformity of the <em>Ethiopian-Arabian</em> style.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="ETHSOD0030007" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/300x180/ETHSOD0030007.jpg 300w,  https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/ETHSOD0030007.jpg 540w" data-src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/ETHSOD0030007.jpg" src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/low/ETHSOD0030007.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://bit.ly/2iYklVo"> Engraved grids and geometric signs.

In Ethiopian rock art it is generally assumed that the oldest depictions could be dated to the mid-third millennium BC, according to parallels with other Saharan rock art. As aforementioned, the so-called Ethiopian-Arabian style shows an evolution from naturalism to schematism, with an older group (Sourré-Hanakiya) showing strong similarities with rock art in Egypt, Sudan and Libya. A second, progressively schematic group (Dahtami) would last until the end of the first millennium BC. This date is supported by the appearance of camels and humped cows (zebus), which were introduced in the region at the end of the second half of the 1st millennium BC. The last stages of Ethiopian rock art relating to camel, warriors and geometric depictions can be considered to belong to the historical period, in some cases reaching very near to the present day.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="ETHGOD0010011" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/300x180/ETHGOD0010011.jpg 300w,  https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/ETHGOD0010011.jpg 540w" data-src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/ETHGOD0010011.jpg" src="https://portableant.github.io/africanrockart/assets/images/site/low/ETHGOD0010011.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://bit.ly/2jztgzY"> : Panel infilled with painted camels, unidentified quadrupeds and geometric signs.
