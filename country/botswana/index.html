It shares a short border consisting of a few hundred metres with Zambia to the north. The majority of this flat country, around 70%, is made up of the Kalahari Desert, with the Okavango Delta, one of the world’s largest inland deltas located in the north. Botswana has a subtropical climate of hot summers and warm winters due to its high altitude and is semi-arid due to the short rainy season. Rock art is scattered across the country with the main sites being found in the Tsodilo Hills in the north- west; the Gubatshaa Hills in the Chobe National Park, east of the Okavango Delta; Tuli Block in the far east of the country and Manyana in the south-east.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="BOTTSDNAS0010017" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="assets/images/site/300x180/BOTTSDNAS0010017_jpeg.jpg 300w, /assets/images/site/BOTTSDNAS0010017_jpeg.jpg 540w" data-src="assets/images/site/BOTTSDNAS0010017_jpeg.jpg" src="../../assets/images/site/low/BOTTSDNAS0010017_jpeg.jpg"> <p class="caption"> Aerial view of Tsodilo Hills, Botswana (2013,2034.21162) © TARA/ David Coulson. </p> </div> <h2 class="chapter-title opened"> Research history </h2> <div class="chapter-content"> <p><p>German geologist Siegfried Passarge visited the Tsodilo Hills on the 1st July 1898, mapping the area, writing on the geology and photographing a few rock paintings. In 1907, he published tracings of his photos in Die Buschmänner der Kalahari. A passing mention of the Hills was made in 1913 in a brief report by Max Happe, but it was François Balsan, a French industrialist and explorer, who raised the profile of Tsodilo Hills when over two days he photographed and prepared tracings of what has come to be known as the “Rhino Panel” on September 27-28 1951.</p> <p>Laurens van der Post’s publication of <em>The Lost World of the Kalahari</em> in 1958 brought Tsodilo Hills and its rock art to the attention of the wider world. Van der Post, an Afrikaner, had planned to make a film of the rock art in the region, but a number of events including the shooting of a steenbok (a severe crime locally), the cameras jamming and swarms of bees descending upon their camp, conspired against him and resulted in van der Post leaving the Hills in despair. However, he also left an apologetic note at the rock art panel he had been trying to film as a way of assuaging the wrath of the “Spirit of the Hills” as he put it. The rock face he was trying to film, comprising eland, giraffe and handprints, is now known as “Van der Post Panel”.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="BOTTSD0040004" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="assets/images/site/300x180/BOTTSD0040004_jpeg.jpg 300w, /assets/images/site/BOTTSD0040004_jpeg.jpg 540w" data-src="assets/images/site/BOTTSD0040004_jpeg.jpg" src="../../assets/images/site/low/BOTTSD0040004_jpeg.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3757916&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=2013,2034.20649&amp;page=1"> View of the Van der Post Panel in the Tsodilo Hills as the sun is setting (2013,2034.20649). © TARA/ David Coulson. </a> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-content"> <p><p>In 1963 Alec Campbell visited the region with George Silberbauer, an ethnographer who had studied the San|Bushmen in Botswana.

Subsequently he collaborated with archaeologists Larry Robbins, Mike Murphy, and paleo-geographer George Brook.</p> <p>During the 1990s, Campbell, along with the staff from the National Museum recorded around 400 rock art sites numbering over 4,000 individual paintings.

This area is characterised by rock engravings of human and animal footprints, and cupules, which hold spiritual importance both for San|Bushman¹ hunter-gatherers and Tswana farmers. The engravings are thought to refer to a local myth that tells of an ancestor, named Matsieng, who is believed to have emerged from a waterhole followed by his animals. However, there are several localities in the region that claim this origin myth. It is thought the engravings in this area were created by the San|Bushmen and linked to their belief system, appropriated later by the Tswana farmers.</p> <p>The most renowned rock art in Botswana comes from the Tsodilo Hills in the north-west of the country. With more than 4,500 paintings preserved in an area of 10km² it has been termed the “Louvre of the Desert”. Tsodilo is made up of four main hills; Male Hill, Female Hill, Child Hill and North Hill, and paintings occur on all four. The subject matter, comprised of red and white paintings, includes animals, human figures and geometric designs. Red paintings are likely to have been made by San|Bushmen, while the white paintings are more difficult to attribute authorship to but may be a later continuation of the red tradition. There are no engraved images at Tsodilo but cupules and ground grooves are a common feature. Dating of the paintings at Tsodilo has been difficult, and because many of them occur on exposed surfaces where they are susceptible to damage by the sun, rain and wind, what remains is probably not very old. However, paintings of cattle, which are also badly faded, probably date to between AD 800 and 1150 when people kept these animals in this area.</p> <p>¹ San|Bushmen is a collective term used to describe the many different hunter-gatherer-fisher groups living in southern Africa who have related languages and cultural traditions. Both ‘San’ and ‘Bushmen’ are considered offensive terms by some members of these groups, although others have positively adopted them.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="BOTTSD0300004" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="assets/images/site/300x180/BOTTSD0300004_jpeg.jpg 300w, /assets/images/site/BOTTSD0300004_jpeg.jpg 540w" data-src="assets/images/site/BOTTSD0300004_jpeg.jpg" src="../../assets/images/site/low/BOTTSD0300004_jpeg.jpg"> <p class="caption"> Two painted rhinoceros on Female Hill, Tsodilo, Botswana (2013,2034.20838). © TARA/ David Coulson. </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="BOTTSD0570002" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="assets/images/site/300x180/BOTTSD0570002_jpeg.jpg 300w, /assets/images/site/BOTTSD0570002_jpeg.jpg 540w" data-src="assets/images/site/BOTTSD0570002_jpeg.jpg" src="../../assets/images/site/low/BOTTSD0570002_jpeg.jpg"> <p class="caption"> Known as the ‘Giraffe Panel’ this site is located on the east side of Female Hill at Tsodilo (2013,2034.20991). © TARA/ David Coulson. </p> </div> <div class="chapter-content"> <p><p>250 km east of the Tsodilo Hills, on the eastern side of the Okavango Delta, lie the Gubatshaa Hills.

The paintings are found at five sites along a rock outcrop of 0.75 km at the base of the Koboleng Hills, and while once richly decorated, many of the paintings have now faded. It is difficult to determine exactly when the paintings were made, but excavation shows the use of ochre from the earliest occupation levels dating to the Late Stone Age, around AD 100 - 800, with the latest occupation levels dating to the Late Iron Age, around AD 1600-1700. Interestingly, none of the paintings were done in white, a colour found at many other sites in Botswana and other regions of southern Africa, and often attributed to paintings of Iron Age date. In addition, there are no images of eland or figures combining human/antelope form which are common occurrences in South African rock art.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="BOTMAN0010005" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="assets/images/site/300x180/BOTMAN0010005_jpeg.jpg 300w, /assets/images/site/BOTMAN0010005_jpeg.jpg 540w" data-src="assets/images/site/BOTMAN0010005_jpeg.jpg" src="../../assets/images/site/low/BOTMAN0010005_jpeg.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3755681&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=2013,2034.20530&amp;page=1"> Three faded yellow giraffe at Manyana (2013,2034.20530). © TARA/ David Coulson. </a> </p> </div> <h2 class="chapter-title opened"> Cupules and grooves </h2> <div class="chapter-content"> <p><p>Cupules and grooves engravings can be found in the Tsodilo Hills, and also in the eastern part of the country in Tuli Block and Gubatshaa Hills.

These may include fertility, health, abundance, protection against evil spirits or summoning rain. Contemporary communities at Tsodilo Hills believe that spirits live in the Hills and have explained how those who enter the Hills must be respectful as the spirits are capable of both curing and punishing people. In particular, White Paintings Shelter in the Tsodilo Hills was used as a place to perform curative dances that involved the placing of hands on the paintings in order to use its power. Geometric designs are more difficult to interpret but may fit into a tradition of other geometric symbols in the region and represent weather and fertility symbols.</p> </p> </div> </div> </div> </article> </div> </main> <div class="super-wrap"> <footer class="footer"> <div class="container"> <div class="column-one-quarter social"> <ul> <li> <div> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/britishmuseum" target="_blank"> <img alt="Facebook" class="svg icon" src="../../assets/icons/facebook.svg"> </a> </div> </li> <li> <div> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/britishmuseum/" target="_blank"> <img alt="Instagram" class="svg icon" src="../../assets/icons/instagram.svg"> </a> </div> </li> <li> <div> <a href="https://twitter.com/britishmuseum" target="_blank"> <img alt="Twitter" class="svg icon" src="../../assets/icons/twitter.svg"> </a> </div> </li> <li> <div> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/britishmuseum" target="_blank"> <img alt="YouTube" class="svg icon" src="../../assets/icons/youtube.svg"> </a> </div> </li> </ul> </div> <div class="column-three-quarters"> <form class="margin16pxB alpha omega clear" id="adestra_footer_form" action="https://britishmuseum.msgfocus.com/s/" method="POST"> <input type="hidden" name="_account_id" value="1552"> <input type="hidden" name="_table_id" value="8"> <input type="hidden" name="_list_id" value="126"> <input type="hidden" name="_dedupe" value="1"> <div class="container"> <div class="column-one-quarter align-right"> <label for="email">Newsletter</label> </div> <div class="column-half collapsed"> <input type="email" name="8.email" id="email" placeholder="Enter your email address..." class="expanded"> </div> <input type="hidden" name="_static_update" value="1"> <input type="hidden" name="_email_field" value="8.email"> <input type="hidden" id="return_page_footer" name="_rp" value="http://emails.britishmuseum.org/k/British-Museum/sign_up_form_from_website_box?email=[*data('email')*]"> <div class="column-one-quarter collapsed"> <button type="submit" value="Sign up" id="footer_submit_button" class="button black more expanded">Sign up </button> </div> </div> </form> </div> </div> <div class="container"> <div class="column-one-third"> <nav> <ul> <li> <p><a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us.aspx" target="_blank">About</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press.aspx" target="_blank">Press</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_this_site/footer_components/contact_us.aspx" target="_blank">Contact us</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_this_site/footer_components/faqs.aspx" target="_blank">FAQ</a></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_this_site/footer_components/terms_of_use.aspx" target="_blank">Legal</a></p> </li> </ul> </nav> </div> <div class="column-one-third"> <h4>Come work with us!</h4> <p>Find opportunities within the British Museum and the British Museum Company.</p> <p><a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/jobs.aspx" class="more" target="_blank">See jobs</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/volunteers.aspx" class="more" target="_blank">See volunteer opportunities</a></p> </div> <div class="column-one-third"> <p>The British Museum,<br/> Great Russell Street,<br/> London WC1B 3DG,<br/> United Kingdom</p> <p>+44 (0)20 7323 8000<br/> <a href="mailto:info@britishmuseum.org">info@britishmuseum.org</a></p> </div> </div> <div class="container"> <div class="column-half"> <p><a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/PDF/Modern Slavery Act Transparency Statement 2015-16.pdf">Modern Slavery Act Statement</a></p> </div> <div class="column-half align-right"> <p>&copy;
