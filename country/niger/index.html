The climate is mainly hot and dry with much of the country covered by the Sahara desert. In the extreme south, on the edges of the Sahel, the terrain is mainly shrub savannah.</p> <p>Unlike other regions in northern Africa, in the absence of a generally agreed chronology, scholars have categorised the rock art of Niger regionally and stylistically, making connections where possible with rock art of other regions.

Approximately 1,000 engravings of warriors have been recorded from the Aïr Mountains in Niger, as well as the Adrar des Iforas in bordering Mali. Based on investigations into the garments worn, accessories, headdresses and weaponry, and by studying the placement and superimposition of images, it has been proposed that there are two main stages of this Libyan Warrior rock art. The oldest is linked to a pastoral economy based on cattle-rearing, when metal had been introduced to the region and the use of the spear took over from the traditional bow. This region also hosts images of wild animals such as Barbary sheep and ostrich, as well as cattle.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-content"> <p><p><strong>Djado Plateau</strong></p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="2013,2034.8891" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="/assets/images/site/300x180/2013_2034.8891.jpg 300w, /assets/images/site/2013_2034.8891.jpg 540w" data-src="/assets/images/site/2013_2034.8891.jpg" src="../../assets/images/site/low/2013_2034.8891.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3637764&amp;partId=1&amp;museumno=2013,2034.8891&amp;page=1"> Two outline engravings of white rhinoceros. 2013,2034.8891 © TARA/David Coulson </a> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-content"> <p><p>Here, both paintings and engravings occur.

Moreover, Henri Lhote noted the resemblance between these rock art depictions and the husbandry practices of the present day Wodaabe people of Niger, who use a similar calf rope. The calf rope (a long rope comprising loops within which the heads of the calves are secured) is both practical and symbolic, ensuring the cows always return to their home camp, while also physically dividing the camp into male and female halves. It is interesting to note the close relationship between the rock art of regions that today are politically discrete.</p> </p> </div> <h2 class="chapter-title opened"> History of rock art discovery in Niger </h2> <div class="chapter-content"> <p><p>Until relatively recently rock art research has been sporadic in Niger. In the 1920s Major Gen. Francis Rodd, a British explorer and army officer, made two great expeditions into the Sahara. He was the first person to make a serious study of the Tuareg and documented some of the rock art in the Aïr Mountains. Subsequently, French colonial officers noted some sites around 1960. However, it was French archaeologist Henri Lhote who undertook major recording programmes throughout the 1960s and 1970s to document, trace and publish several thousand engravings. Very little information is known relating the rock art to known cultural groups, either past or present. Most of the sites were not habitation sites, and were probably only occasionally visited by nomadic societies in the past, so very little (if any) archaeological evidence remains. Most of the art predates the residence of the Tuareg, who now inhabit this area and who appear to have no direct connections with the art. The Tuareg recognise old script which sometimes accompanies images as it closely resembles their own writing, <em>Tifinagh</em>; however, it is incomprehensible to them if it is more than 100 years old.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="2013,2034.10009" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="/assets/images/site/300x180/2013_2034.10009.jpg 300w, /assets/images/site/2013_2034.10009.jpg 540w" data-src="/assets/images/site/2013_2034.10009.jpg" src="../../assets/images/site/low/2013_2034.10009.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3637714&amp;partId=1&amp;museumno=2013,2034.10009&amp;page=1"> Large reground and painted figure surrounded by ancient Tifinagh script.
