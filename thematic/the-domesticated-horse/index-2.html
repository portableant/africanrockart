By this point, horses had probably only been domesticated for about 2,000 years, but with the advent of the chariot after the 3rd millennium BC in Mesopotamia, the horse proved to be a valuable martial asset in the ancient world. One of the first clear records of the use of horses and chariots in battle in Africa is found in depictions from the mortuary complex of the Pharaoh Ahmose at Abydos from around 1,525 BC, showing their use by Egyptians in defeating the Hyksos, and horses feature prominently in later Egyptian art.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="2013,2034.1001" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="assets/images/site/300x180/2013_2034.1001.jpg 300w, /assets/images/site/2013_2034.1001.jpg 540w" data-src="assets/images/site/2013_2034.1001.jpg" src="../../assets/images/site/low/2013_2034.1001.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3588526&amp;partId=1&amp;people=197356&amp;museumno=2013,2034.1001&amp;page=1"> Fig. 2.

These distinctive images are characterised by depictions of one or more horses pulling a chariot with their legs outstretched in a stylised manner and are sometimes attributed to the Garamantes, a group who were a local power in the central Sahara from about 500 BC-700 AD. But the Ajjer Plateau is over a thousand miles from the Nile- how and when did the horse and chariot first make their way across the Western Desert to the rest of North Africa in the first place? Egyptian accounts indicate that by the 11th century BC Libyans (people living on the north African coast around the border of modern Egypt and Libya) were using chariots in war. Classical sources later write about the chariots of the Garamantes and of chariot use by peoples of the far western Sahara continuing into the 1st century BC, by which time the chariot horse had largely been eclipsed in war by the cavalry mount.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="2013,2034.4574" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="assets/images/site/300x180/2013_2034.4574.jpg 300w, /assets/images/site/2013_2034.4574.jpg 540w" data-src="assets/images/site/2013_2034.4574.jpg" src="../../assets/images/site/low/2013_2034.4574.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3603790&amp;partId=1&amp;people=197356&amp;museumno=2013,2034.4574+&amp;page=1"> Fig. 3.

Riding may have been practiced since the earliest times of horse domestication, though the earliest definitive depictions of horses being ridden come from the Middle East in the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia BC. Images of horses and riders in rock art occur in various areas of Morocco, Egypt and Sudan and are particularly notable in the Ennedi region of Chad and the Adrar and Tagant plateaus in Mauritania (interestingly, however, no definite images of horses are known in the Gilf Kebir/Jebel Uweinat area at the border of Egypt, Sudan and Libya).</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="ME22958" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="assets/images/site/300x180/ME22958.jpg 300w, /assets/images/site/ME22958.jpg 540w" data-src="assets/images/site/ME22958.jpg" src="../../assets/images/site/low/ME22958.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=388860&amp;partId=1&amp;people=197356&amp;museumno=22958&amp;page=1"> Fig. 4.

Image not yet catalogued. </p> </div> <div class="chapter-content"> <p><p>Traditional chronologies for Saharan rock art areas tend to place depictions of ridden horses chronologically after those of horses and chariots, and in general use horse depictions to categorise regional stylistic periods of rock art according to broad date boundaries. As such, in most places, the ‘horse’ rock art period is usually said to cover about a thousand years from the end of the 2nd millennium BC. It is then considered to be succeeded by a ‘camel’ period, where the appearance of images of dromedaries – known only to have been introduced to the eastern Sahara from Arabia at the end of the 1st century BC – reflects the next momentous influx of a beast of burden to the area and thus a new dating parameter (read more about depictions of camels in the Sahara). However, such simplistic categorisation can be misleading. For one thing, although mounting horses certainly gained popularity over driving them, it is not always clear that depictions of ridden horses are not contemporary with those of chariots. Further, the horse remained an important martial tool after the use of war-chariots declined. Even after the introduction of the camel, there are several apparently contemporary depictions featuring both horse and camel riders.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="2013,2034.5739" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="assets/images/site/300x180/2013_2034.5739.jpg 300w, /assets/images/site/2013_2034.5739.jpg 540w" data-src="assets/images/site/2013_2034.5739.jpg" src="../../assets/images/site/low/2013_2034.5739.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3619780&amp;partId=1&amp;people=197356&amp;museumno=2013,2034.5739+&amp;page=1"> Fig. 6.

Berber peoples would remain heavily associated with horse breeding and riding, and the later rock art of Mauritania has been attributed to Berber horsemen, or the sight of them. Although horses may already have reached the areas of modern Mauritania and Mali by this point, archaeological evidence does not confirm their presence in these south-westerly regions of the Sahara until much later, in the mid-1st millennium AD, and it has been suggested that some of the horse paintings in Mauritania may be as recent as 16th century.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="2013,2034.5202" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="assets/images/site/300x180/2013_2034.5202.jpg 300w, /assets/images/site/2013_2034.5202.jpg 540w" data-src="assets/images/site/2013_2034.5202.jpg" src="../../assets/images/site/low/2013_2034.5202.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3624404&amp;partId=1&amp;people=197356&amp;museumno=2013,2034.5202&amp;page=1"> Fig. 7.

Indeed, discernible images of such accoutrements in Saharan rock art can help to date it following the likely introduction of the equipment to the area: for example, the clear depiction of saddles suggests an image to be no older than the 1st century AD; images including stirrups are even more recent.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="RRM12824" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="assets/images/site/300x180/RRM12824.jpg 300w, /assets/images/site/RRM12824.jpg 540w" data-src="assets/images/site/RRM12824.jpg" src="../../assets/images/site/low/RRM12824.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=217451&amp;partId=1&amp;page=1"> Fig. 8. 19th-century Moroccan stirrups with typical curved base of the type possibly visible in the image above.

Ancient Mesopotamian horses were generally depicted as heavily-built, and It has been suggested that the basic type for the delicate Arabian horse, with its dished (concave) facial profile and high-set tail, may have been developed in north-east Africa prior to its subsequent appearance and cultivation in Arabia, and that these features may be observed in Ancient Egyptian images from the New Kingdom. Likewise, there is the possibility that some of the more naturalistic paintings from the central Sahara show the similarly gracile features of the progenitors of the Barb, distinguishable from the Arab by its straight profile and low-set tail. Like the Arab, the Barb is a desert horse: hardy, sure-footed and able to withstand great heat; it is recognised as an ancient breed with an important genetic legacy, both in the ancestry of the Iberian horses later used throughout the Americas, and that of the modern racing thoroughbred.</p> </p> </div> <div class="chapter-image"> <img alt="2013,2034.1452" class="lazyload" data-sizes="auto" data-srcset="assets/images/site/300x180/2013_2034.1452.jpg 300w, /assets/images/site/2013_2034.1452.jpg 540w" data-src="assets/images/site/2013_2034.1452.jpg" src="../../assets/images/site/low/2013_2034.1452.jpg"> <p class="caption"> <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3592678&amp;partId=1&amp;people=197356&amp;museumno=2013,2034.1452&amp;page=1"> Fig. 9.

Indeed, there is huge diversity of horse depictions throughout northern Africa, with some forms highly schematic.
